virtualisation is a method of running multiple operating systems or servers at
 the same on the same 
hardware or on the same base software.
it  is of two types:
*Type 1 Virtualisation
* Type 2 Virtualisation


In Type 1 virtualisation we have multiple operating systems are   
running directly on the hardware with the help of a management software.
This type of virtualisation is faster than type 2 as it uses dyanamic ram distribution system.
 
          In Type 2 virtualisation we have multiple os running on basic os
with the help of virtual machine or hypervisor.This is slower than the former
one .
    virtualisation of  servers can also be done . Example of server
 virtualisation is internet.
