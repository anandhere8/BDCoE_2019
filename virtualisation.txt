Virtualisation is a process of creating a virtual environment.By this method we
can run multiple operating systems on the same hardware.

Virtualisation can be categorised into the following two types:
1.Type 1 virtualisation
2.Type 2 virtualisation

Type 1 virtualisation: In this type we can run multiple operating systems on the
hardware directly but we need to install management software for that.This is
faster as compared to type 2 because it has direct access to the hardware and
no software is present in between.Also it is more efficient because each os
takes only required amount of memory independent of the partitions done.
    
 
Type 2 virtualsation:In this type we can run multiple operating systems by 
installing a VM ware or virtual box on top of the pre-existing operating
system.This is slower and less efficient than type 1 as in this each os takes
memory according to the partition done irrespective of its usage.It is more 
protective than the previous one as if the os present on vm ware gets 
corrupted then it effects the virtual box only and the hardware remains safe.
